All Category SEO Updater works in tandem with All In One SEO to deliver high quality SEO for your main category pages.

== Description ==

This much needed plug-in for Wordpress adds the ability for the user to further customize category pages as well as additional SEO functionality. This plug-in works in conjunction with the All in One SEO plug-in.

**SEO Features:** The All Category SEO plug-in allows for the addition of H1 or primary heading tags on category pages as well as the three basic tags including the page title, meta description and meta keywords tag. Further, an input box allows for a custom, keyword rich description to be added to the category page. This description input box also accepts HTML and CSS code for further customization allowing you to insert images with alternative text or other design features. This functionality is the brainchild of Gabriel Goldenberg of [SEO ROI](http://seoroi.com/ "SEOROI") and Jeremy Dearringer of [Slingshot SEO](http://www.slingshotseo.com "Slingshot SEO"). As leaders in the SEO community, these individuals can attest to the SEO advantages of such a plug-in. Further, solid functionality and regular updates can be trusted to the developer [Bradley Smith](http://bradleygsmith.com/ "Wordpress Username bradleygsmith"), the lead programmer at [Slingshot SEO](http://www.slingshotseo.com "Slingshot SEO"). 

Additional Functionality:

* Color Selector and Basic Input Box for H1
